# Phiala Jane Thouvenin's Portfolio

My professional coding portfolio.

[Here](resume_PJT.pdf) is my resume.

### Scientific Data Processing Examples
[Here](ML_interp.md) is an example of simple machine learning tools as applied to missing particle tracking data. This uses Scikit-learn and Pandas.

[Here](particle_displacer_demo.md) is an example of code I wrote to displace synthetic particles using a k-d tree method and particle image velocimetry data, further utilizing Pandas for data analysis. [[repo]](https://github.com/phialahydrite/sptv_code)

[Here](surface_masking_demo.md) is an example of code I wrote to mask images based on foreground and background estimation, using Pandas, HDF5, and image processing tools. [[repo]](https://github.com/phialahydrite/surface_generator)

[Here](slope_calculator.md) is an example of using the surfaces generated in the previous example to give an estimate of surface slope, using Pandas, HDF5, and image processing tools. [[repo]](https://github.com/phialahydrite/slope_calculator)

[Here](gmt_test.md) is an example of manipulating NumPy arrays and saving them as scientific grid file formats (for Generic Mapping Tools and netCDF4). [[repo]](https://github.com/phialahydrite/gridfile)

### Digital Signal Processing Examples

[Here](https://github.com/phialahydrite/morphagene_batchnorm) is a repo used to batch normalize and amplify Make Noise Morphagene reels while preserving splice locations already present in the reels.
