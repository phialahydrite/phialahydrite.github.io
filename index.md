## Phiala Jane Thouvenin's Portfolio

My professional coding portfolio.

[Here](resume_PJT.pdf) is my resume.

[Here](surface_masking_demo.md) is an example of code I wrote to mask images based on foreground and background estimation, using Pandas, HDF5, and other tools.

[Here](particle_displacer_demo.md) is an example of code I wrote to displace seeded particles using a k-d tree method, further utilizing Pandas for data analysis.
