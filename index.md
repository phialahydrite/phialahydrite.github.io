[Here](particle_displacer_demo.md) is an example of code I wrote to displace synthetic particles using a k-d tree method and particle image velocimetry data, further utilizing Pandas for data analysis. [[repo]](https://github.com/phialahydrite/sptv_code)

[Here](surface_masking_demo.md) is an example of code I wrote to mask images based on foreground and background estimation, using Pandas, HDF5, and image processing tools. [[repo]](https://github.com/phialahydrite/surface_generator)

[Here](slope_calculator.md) is an example of using the surfaces generated in the previous example to give an estimate of surface slope, using Pandas, HDF5, and image processing techniques. [[repo]](https://github.com/phialahydrite/slope_calculator)
